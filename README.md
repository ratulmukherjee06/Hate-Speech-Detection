# 🛡️ Hate Speech Detection on Social Media using NLP + Machine Learning

This project detects **Hate Speech**, **Offensive Language**, and **Neutral content** in tweets using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. It is built as a **Capstone Project** during a Data Science internship, with a focus on model interpretability, reproducibility, and presentation-ready insights.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Social media platforms like Twitter are often plagued by hate speech and offensive language. Manual moderation is infeasible at scale. This project aims to build a **Machine Learning Model** that can automatically classify tweets into:

- **0 → Hate Speech**
- **1 → Offensive Language**
- **2 → Neither (Neutral)**

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Clean and preprocess tweet text
- Vectorize text using TF-IDF
- Train ML models (Random Forest, etc.)
- Evaluate and visualize model performance
- Package the pipeline for reproducibility
